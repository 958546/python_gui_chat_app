# Version 01
## Python GUI Chat App
This is a client-server chat app made with python
### How To Run
You need to add your ip/localhost in the client.py/server.py
```python
# server.py/client.py
HOST = '' # Your IP
PORT = 9999 # Your Port
```
To change your name just edit the settings.json
```json
{
  "NAME": "YourAwesomeName",
  "RANK": "Undefined"
}
```
Then just start the server.py, client.py and start Chatting :D
