# Version 01
## Python GUI Chat App
This is a client-server chat app made with python
### How To Run
You need to add your ip/localhost in the client.py
```python
# server.py
HOST = '' # Your IP
PORT = 9999 # Your Port
```
To change your name just edit the settings.json
```json
{
  "NAME": "YourAwesomeName",
  "RANK": "Undefined"
}
```
Then just start the server.py, client.py and start Chatting :D
## TODO
```
1. Add colored text to chat names
2. Add colored text when someone joins the chat/leaves
```
I will try to update the repo and add new stuff asap!
